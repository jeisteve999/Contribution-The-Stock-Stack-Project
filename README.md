# EDA Contribution – The Stock Stack Project

🔗 **Original Project:** [The Stock Stack on GitHub](https://github.com/jeisteve999/The-Stock-Stack)

This repository contains my personal contribution to the collaborative project "The Stock Stack," which focuses on building a full stock data pipeline and forecast system.

As a Junior Data Analyst, I was in charge of the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, where I explored stock data, cleaned it, and extracted key insights.

## 🧠 Main EDA Tasks
- Data cleaning and exploration (missing values, outliers)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- Visualizations (line plots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps)
- Identified patterns and outliers that informed modeling

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
