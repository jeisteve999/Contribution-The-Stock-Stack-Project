This repository contains my personal contribution to the collaborative project *The Stock Stack*, focused on building a full stock data pipeline and forecast system.

As a Junior Data Analyst, my main responsibility was performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on historical stock price data to extract trends, identify anomalies, and prepare the data for modeling and visualization.
